# Bachelor Thesis of Johannes Abele

This repository contains the source code for the electromechanical simulation used in bachlor's thesis written by Johannes Abele at the Max-Planck-Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. The thesis is concerned with predicting electric action potential from previously simulated deformation data. For the prediction via an ESN, the code was adapted from Roland Zimmermann and can be found under https://github.com/zimmerrol/rcp_spatio_temporal#bachelor-thesis-of-roland-zimmermann.
