This folder contains the code written for the electromechanical simulation. The main.c contains the principal simulation functions, whereas other parts of the project have been outsourced to the other .c files. To let the simulation run on a linux-based machine, a makefile is included. All parameters for the simulation can be set in the included configuration file config.ini. The two .py files (plotmechanical.py and plotelectrical.py) are included for visualization purposes.
